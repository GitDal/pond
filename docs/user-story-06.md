# ðŸ¦† Duck Movement in Three.js â€“ User Stories

## User Story 6: Animate Duck Feet with Movement
**As a** viewer,  
**I want** the duckâ€™s feet to animate when it moves,  
**so that** it looks like the duck is walking naturally.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Feet alternate positions in a walking pattern when moving.
- No foot movement occurs when the duck is idle.
- Foot motion is visually synced with body progression.

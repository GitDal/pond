## User Story 3: Implement Head Movement Ahead of Body When Running
**As a** user watching the duck run,  
**I want** the duck's head to move ahead of its body during fast movement,  
**so that** it looks like the duck is leading its motion with its head.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Head moves forward on the Z-axis when speed increases.
- Body gradually follows the head's position with a short delay.
- Smooth animation between head and body movement is visible.

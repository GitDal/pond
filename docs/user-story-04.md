## User Story 4: Make the Duck Turn Head Before Body
**As a** viewer,  
**I want** the duckâ€™s head to turn before the body,  
**so that** it appears the duck is looking before it changes direction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Head rotates first when turning.
- Body rotates to match head direction after a short delay (~300â€“500ms).
- Turn looks natural and intentional.

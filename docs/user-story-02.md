# ðŸ¦† Duck Movement in Three.js â€“ User Stories

## User Story 2: Create a Duck Model Using Only Geometries
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to build a duck composed entirely of basic Three.js geometries,  
**so that** I can delay working with textures and focus on modeling and movement.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Duck is composed of head, body, two feet, and a tail.
- All parts use basic Three.js geometry classes (Box, Sphere, Cylinder, etc.).
- No textures or advanced materials are applied.

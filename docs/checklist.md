# ✅ Duck Project – User Story Checklist

## Movement & Logic First
- [✅] **1.** Prototype Duck Using Only Lines for Initial Movement  
  *Render duck using only lines to focus on movement logic.*

## Geometry Modeling
- [ ] **2.** Create a Duck Model Using Only Geometries  
  *Use Box, Sphere, or Cylinder geometry only – no textures.*

## Movement Behaviors
- [ ] **3.** Implement Head Movement Ahead of Body When Running  
  *Head moves ahead when duck runs; body follows with delay.*

- [ ] **4.** Make the Duck Turn Head Before Body  
  *Head turns first; body follows gradually.*

  *Feet alternate in walk cycle when duck is moving.*

- [ ] **7.** Make Feet Drive Duck Movement

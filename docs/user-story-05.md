# ðŸ¦† Duck Movement in Three.js â€“ User Stories

## User Story 5: Enable Duck Movement on and Off a Plane
**As a** user,  
**I want** the duck to be able to move on a plane and also leave it,  
**so that** Iâ€™m not restricted to one surface.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A `PlaneGeometry` serves as the ground.
- Duck can move freely in 3D space, including off the plane.
- Movement remains smooth and controlled in all directions.

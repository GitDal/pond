# ðŸ¦† Duck Movement in Three.js â€“ User Stories

## User Story 7: Make Feet Drive Duck Movement
**As a** user observing movement,  
**I want** the duck to move only when a foot is planted in front of the body,  
**so that** the feet dictate movement rather than the body.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Movement is triggered only when a foot moves ahead and contacts the "ground."
- Duck's body advances after a stepping motion.
- Foot motion leads body motion, not the other way around.

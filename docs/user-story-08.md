# ðŸ¦† Duck Movement in Three.js â€“ User Stories

## User Story 8: Add Duck Tail with Random Wiggle Behavior
**As a** user,  
**I want** the duckâ€™s tail to periodically or randomly wiggle,  
**so that** it adds a sense of life and animation to the duck.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Tail is a separate component connected to the back of the body.
- Tail performs small random or periodic wiggle animations.
- Wiggle behavior is independent of walking or direction changes.

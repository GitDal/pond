# ðŸ¦† Duck Movement in Three.js â€“ User Stories

## User Story 1: Prototype Duck Using Only Lines for Initial Movement
**As a** developer,  
**I want** to render the duck using only `Line` or `LineSegments` in Three.js,  
**so that** I can focus on perfecting the movement logic before implementing full 3D visuals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The duck is represented using `THREE.Line` or `THREE.LineSegments` for all body parts.
- Lines show head, body, feet, and tail locations and orientations.
- All movement behaviors (foot-driven motion, head-first turning, tail wiggle) work in this line-based version.
- No full 3D geometries or textures are used at this stage.
